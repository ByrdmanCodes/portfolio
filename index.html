<p class="textcolor">Chi Byrd (from Houston, TX) moved to Orlando, FL in 2011. He is a Graphic Design and Web Development student at F.I.R.S.T. Institute and works hotel security full-time. After serving in the United States Navy (2002-2006) the benefits he received allowed him to strive for a college education, particularly in the creative field. As a fan of comics, animation, and illustration, Chi spends many of his days at the drawing table sketching and viewing Netflix. He can be found in the gym every morning lifting the weights, all of the weights.
